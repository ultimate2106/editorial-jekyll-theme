      So I guess it's time to introduce myself :) <br />
      I am Dominic Schroeder, 27 years old and from Germany. Currently I am studying computer science and doing my bachelor exam. Soon I am done and looking for jobs!

      In my free time I am learning about new IT stuff and do different projects. This website is one of them and will have a place under "IT Projects". I also bought some books I am working on from time to time. One is about Design Patterns and the other about AI (Neural Networks) in Python. <br /> <br />

      The thing I love to learn about the most is Unity3D and Game-Development! I've always had an interest in developing games and one day I found a bundle on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com">Humble Bundle</a> that had a lot about game development like assets and a special course about 2D development in Unity from <a href="https://www.gamedevhq.com">GameDevHQ (GDHQ)</a>! Now, a while later, I am reading a lot of articles about game development, take courses, join webinars to learn new techniques and skills (from GDHQ) and always try to improve. Currently I have a project where I create a game called "Jurassic Solitaire".

    Another really important part of my life is Anime & Manga and everything related to it. I love going to conventions, tho currently not possible (thanks Corona..), and enjoy watching, reading and even playing anything related. Because I felt like missing out on a lot without being able to read and understand Japanese, I started learning the language! If you want to follow me on my journey and maybe learn together with me, you can read about what I learned recently in my blog articles found in the navbar :)

    Thanks for reading this wall of text and if you're interested in any of my projects you'll find them in the navbar. You also can reach out to me by writing me an e-mail.
